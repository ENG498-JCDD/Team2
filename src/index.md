# National Parks and Economic Struggle  

## Exigence and Problem

Recent executive orders and defunding of departments and agencies in the federal government have resulted in the depletion of resources available for the maintenance of parks and people employed by the National Park Service. Simultaneously, there is a recession (one could argue a depression) being felt throughout the United States. We believe that there could be a link between national parks visitation and economic difficulty. 

## Hypothesis

Visits to national parks increase when there is economic instability in the country as they provide inexpensive forms of entertainment. We measure this via State GDP and State Unemployment Rate

### Specifying Questions

1. "How do trends in state unemployment align with trends in NPS visitation?"
   - Data display ideas: using line graphs to display the changes in unemployment rates and NPS visitation over time in months.
2.  "How do trends in State GDP align with trends in NPS visitation?"
    - Data display ideas: using line graphs to display the changes in unemployment rates and NPS visitation over time in months.
3.  "How do trends in State GDP align with trends in state unemployment"
    - Data display ideas: using line graphs to display GDP and state unemployment overlaid or side by  side so patterns could be observed.

## Project Aims

For our project, we wanted to highlight the importance of national parks as affordable and accessible attractions for americans, especially at a time when the funding and integrity of national parks is under fire by the current administration. We wanted to show users the relationship between our two economic metrics (state GDP and state unemployment) and the visitation rates across the past several years. We also supplied additional data to add to the context around these central relationships, such as ticket prices and geographic location. We hope users can use this dashboard to observe this relationship and simultaneously learn a little about national parks!

## Conclusions and Patterns

<!-- so we said that these are the following main findings...
* Patterns vary regionally
* east, midwest, north east (maybe south?) visitation increases when unemplyment falls (and usually when unemployment increases, GDP decreases)
* west, north west, visitation decreases when unemployment increases (opposite above)
* heat map of cost? 
* maybe add a subheading of affordability and include map here as well as in the dashboard? -->
