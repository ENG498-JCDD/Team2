# National Park Visitation and Economic Turmoil - an Overview

The following report outlines the history, function, and recent attacks from captiol hill on national parks, as well as an exploration on how they provide entertainment and value to Americans, perhaps especially during times of economic difficulty. We hypothesize that visits to national parks increase when there is economic instability in the country, as they provide inexpensive forms of entertainment and enrichment to visitors. During a period of increasing economic and political uncertainty, it is important to highlight the values that publicly funded provide to society.

## Background and History of the National Parks Service and System

In 1872, Congress established the first national park, Yellowstone National Park, for the "benefit and enjoyment of the people". This sparked a movement worldwide to create national parks and preserves. Under the Department of the Interior in the years following Yellowstone's creation, more parks and monuments were created, providing employment opportunities to Americans. In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson signed the "The National Park Service Organic Act", creating the National Park Service within the Department of the Interior to protect and manage current and future national parks and monuments. Now, the National Park System runs over 400 areas over 84 million acres across the United States and its territories.

## Recent Challenges Facing the National Park Service

In the last several months specifically, there have been many challenges that national parks have had to deal with. These stem from the change in Executive Administration, after Former President Donald Trump was re-elected for a second term in 2024. This change has seen a drastic cut in national park funding, a forced re-wrting of their history on federally-run websites to align with the priorities of the Trump Administration, and a government shut down that ran for 43 days (the longest in US history) which saw national park and Dept. of the Interior workers go over a month without pay. 

These challeneges make it to where parks must make the decision to stay open while understaffed, a potentially dangerous decision for visitors as well as natural and cultural sites, or remain closed and lose out on visitation.
If parks decide to close, then that is a major economic loss to their communities, especially those that depend on tourism as a driver of economic activity and income.

Other than these more recent challenges, national parks are chronically understafed and underfunded during the best conditions. They also face risks associated with climate change, energy development, and America's aging infrastructure.

## National Parks and the Economy

National parks are a popular attraction among people both in and outside of the United States, and as such they bring business and tourism to cities and states all across the country. Additonally, their ticket and admission prices are typically pretty low, making them affordable for everyone, and allowing low-income people access to the best of North America's natural beauty. 

For our dashboard, we have found data beginning in 2008, the beginning of the 2008 Financial Crisis (AKA "The Great Recession") which was caused by a crashing housing market in the United States that had world-wide implications. We thought beginning out data story here would allow users to get a thorough picture of the last nearly two decades of American economic highs and lows to compare to national park visitation and entry costs.
